Vector fields serve as course commands to the MAV

 

The notion of vector fields is similar to that of potential fields, which have been widely used as a tool for path planning in the robotics community.
 
Vector fields are different from potential fields in that they do not necessarily represent the gradient of a potential. Rather, the vector field simply indicates a desired direction of travel
 

 

Two primitive path types are used (straight lines, and circular orbits)
To spice together paths made up of straight lines and circular arcs, each portion of the path is turned on and off depending on the time or location of the UAV. By only having a single field active at any given time, you prevent dead zones, singularities, or kinks that would otherwise be present when summing the field. The challenge then becomes when and where to transition between these zones. For complex geometry this may be difficult

Dynamic path-planning algorithm for tracking ground targets
Combines Tangent Vector Field Guidance (TVFG) and Lyapunov Vector Field Guidance (LVFG)
Theoretically optimal path is derived with UAV operational constraints
Only physical limitations considered (max turn rate, nominal cruising speed)
Appears to be an interesting optimal take on Dubins path. Some initial state (x,y,heading) and a goal state (xg,yg,heading) with some constraints. Find the optimal way to get from one state to the

 
The overall goal is to transition from these initial to goal states, and like Dubins paths, it will be constructed of straight line and circular arcs. The line to enter the second circular path will always be tangent to the turn.
 
Two propositions

Shortest distance to objective circle around a target, the optimal UAV path is found by using the nearest Tangent Vector Field Guidance
If the tangents are available between a UAVs turning limit circle and an objective circle, TVFG provides more efficient path planning than LVFG

 

Tangent VF guidance provides a more efficient path (Distance wise) than Lyapunov
Lyapunov also fails to converge to the circle and has some offset (the offset is dependent on the UAVs velocity and the sampling interval)
Tangent VF has no guidance inside of the objective circle, therefore two low hanging fruit are available to remedy this issue


 Continue forward movement until a guidance vector is available
Use Lyapunov inside of the objective circle

 
Obstacle Avoidance
 

Algorithm considers obstacles by placing an objective circle around the obstacle so that the UAV will be guided around said obstacle. Problem with generalizing all objects as circular regions removes free space from the mission that would otherwise be available (think a long obstacle that would be better suited for a elliptical "objective field"

This work is motivated by the need to redesign the potential field each time an environment change is detected.
 

 

Previous research has focused on either known or unknown environments
This paper"bridges" the gap between these two methods

 

Our basic idea is to construct a discontinuous vector field which acts as the predefined navigation field away from unmodelled obstacles and as a vorticity-line field close to them
 

The above statement reinforces the idea that the arbitrary categories of potential field and vector field, really are not separate. A potential field is in fact a vector field.

Completeness - Guaranteed to find a solution if one exists
Reactive motion planning is the real time response from external stimuli (sensors, etc) to respond to changes in the environment, which works well for dynamic environments. These reactive motion planners may not have a solution
Static obstacles known at the generation of map

 

Since we place few restrictions on the dynamic nature of the constraints one cannot always guarantee that the problem can be solved globally

It appears the above statement is still correct to this day, at least in terms of guarunteeing a solution for a dynamic environment in which the dynamics are not known in full a priori 
 
Navigation functions represent an algorithmically complete closed loop solution to the planning problem
 
 

Proposition 1 looks very familiar to Goncalves work for generating vector fields, excluding the time varying term.

Traditionally obstacle avoidance has been a high level controls problem (Esentially, don't even go in that area)
PF lets you distribute avoidance into multiple layers of control
PF implemented into a robotic manipulator
Time varying Potential field for moving obstacles

 

Operational Space Formulation is the basis for the application of the potential field approach to robot manipulators
 


Paper focuses strongly on the fundamentals of the operational space formulation and the artificial potential field concept
Lagrangian equation (minimal energy, principle of least action)

 
Artificial Potential Field Approach

Presented in the context of manipulator collision avoidance


The manipulator moves in a field of forces. The position to be reached is an attractive pole for the end effector and obstacles are repulsive surfaces for the manipulator parts

 

Artificial forces are applied to the manipulator from the PF, which are determined by the negative gradient
The field, if interpreted straight up, will give both direction and magnitude. In this instance, the magnitude is limited to some v\_max, but the direction is maintained
Obstacle field should be nonnegative, continuous, and differentiable, tend to infinity

 

Used a peicewise decay function (my words, not Khatib's) to limit the influence of the obstacle

 

Local minima can occur in the resultant potential field...this can lead to a stable positioning of the robot before reaching its goal
